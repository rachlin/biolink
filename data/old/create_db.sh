# Run a cypher query to create the Nodes and Relations in the Neo4J instance
# By default, Neo4j prevents using LOAD CSV (which is in our cypher query and helps read from CSV files) from
# files that aren't in the default imports directory. Moving these CSVs there can be a hassled. Instead,
# we can remove this constraint!
# Check your Neo4j instance's config file:
# - by default on Ubuntu, it's here: /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
# Look for: dbms.directories.import=/var/lib/neo4j/import . Comment that out and restart your Neo4j instance!
